## Project Overview

PIC DATA HUB is my first TypeScript React project aimed at creating a place for visualizing some common image metadata and EXIF data. The main focus of this project is to display common image metadata and EXIF data, especially the location where the image was taken, as this information is not readily available in the standard properties of an image on mobile or PC.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Easily upload images to the platform.
- **Categorization**: Organize images into categories for better management.
- **Metadata Management**: Add and edit metadata for each image, including:
  - File Name
  - File Size
  - File Type
  - Date Modified
  - Dimensions
  - Date Created
  - Resolution
  - Camera Model
  - Lens
  - Location

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Image Processing**: Exifr
- **Hosting**: Vercel (Project link: [PIC DATA HUB](http://pic-data-hub.vercel.app))
